# Alembic Migration

This directory contains Alembic migration scripts for our Flask application.

## How to Run Migrations

1. To generate a new migration script, run the following command:

```bash
flask db migrate -m "Your message"
```

2. To apply the migrations to the database, run the following command:

```bash
flask db upgrade
```

3. To rollback the last migration, run the following command:

```bash
flask db downgrade
```

## Important Notes

- Always review the generated migration scripts and make sure they are correct.
- Always test your migrations before applying them to the production database.
- Keep your migration scripts under version control.
- Never change a migration script after it has been applied to the database.
